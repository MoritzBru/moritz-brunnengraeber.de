# Protect website against clickjacking.
#
# The example below sends the `X-Frame-Options` response header with the value
# `DENY`, informing browsers not to display the content of the web page in any
# frame.
#
# This might not be the best setting for everyone. You should read about the
# other two possible values the `X-Frame-Options` header field can have:
# `SAMEORIGIN` and `ALLOW-FROM`.
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-2.1.
#
# Keep in mind that while you could send the `X-Frame-Options` header for all
# of your website's pages, this has the potential downside that it forbids even
# non-malicious framing of your content.
#
# Nonetheless, you should ensure that you send the `X-Frame-Options` header for
# all pages that allow a user to make a state-changing operation (e.g: pages
# that contain one-click purchase links, checkout or bank-transfer confirmation
# pages, pages that make permanent configuration changes, etc.).
#
# Sending the `X-Frame-Options` header can also protect your website against
# more than just clickjacking attacks.
# https://cure53.de/xfo-clickjacking.pdf.
#
# (!) The `Content-Security-Policy` header has a `frame-ancestors` directive
#     which obsoletes this header for supporting browsers.

# | Content Security Policy (CSP)                                      |
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting and other content-injection
# attacks.
#
# This can be done by setting a Content Security Policy which permits
# trusted sources of content for your website.
#
# There is no policy that fits all websites, you will have to modify the
# `Content-Security-Policy` directives in the example depending on your needs.
#
# The example policy below aims to:
#
#  (1) Restrict all fetches by default to the origin of the current website by
#      setting the `default-src` directive to `'self'` - which acts as a
#      fallback to all "Fetch directives" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fetch_directive).
#
#      This is convenient as you do not have to specify all Fetch directives
#      that apply to your site, for example:
#      `connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'`, etc.
#
#      This restriction also means that you must explicitly define from which
#      site(s) your website is allowed to load resources from.
#
#  (2) The `<base>` element is not allowed on the website. This is to prevent
#      attackers from changing the locations of resources loaded from relative
#      URLs.
#
#      If you want to use the `<base>` element, then `base-uri 'self'` can be
#      used instead.
#
#  (3) Form submissions are only allowed from the current website by setting:
#      `form-action 'self'`.
#
#  (4) Prevents all websites (including your own) from embedding your webpages
#      within e.g. the `<iframe>` or `<object>` element by setting:
#      `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
#
#      The `frame-ancestors` directive helps avoid "Clickjacking" attacks and
#      is similar to the `X-Frame-Options` header.
#
#      Browsers that support the CSP header should ignore `X-Frame-Options` if
#      `frame-ancestors` is also specified.
#
#  (5) Elements controlled by `object-src` are perhaps coincidentally
#      considered legacy HTML elements and are not receiving new standardized
#      features (such as the security attributes `sandbox` or `allow` for
#      `<iframe>`).
#      Therefore it is recommended to restrict this fetch-directive (e.g.,
#      explicitly set `object-src 'none'` if possible).
#
#  (6) Forces the browser to treat all the resources that are served over HTTP
#      as if they were loaded securely over HTTPS by setting the
#      `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive.
#
#      Please note that `upgrade-insecure-requests` does not ensure HTTPS for
#      the top-level navigation. If you want to force the website itself to be
#      loaded over HTTPS you must include the `Strict-Transport-Security`
#      header.
#
#  (7) The `Content-Security-Policy` header is included in all responses
#      that are able to execute scripting. This includes the commonly used
#      file types: HTML, XML and PDF documents. Although Javascript files
#      can not execute script in a "browsing context", they are still included
#      to target workers:
#      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#CSP_in_workers
#
# To make your CSP implementation easier, you can use an online CSP header
# generator such as:
# https://report-uri.com/home/generate/
#
# It is encouraged that you validate your CSP header using a CSP validator
# such as:
